# Masters Final Project

Welcome to the documentation site! The final project for my MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence degree. In collaboration with the **Sensing the Forest** organization, this project will aim to take a livestreamed audio soundscape of a forest and remove human voices, before publishing it to the website for the public to enjoy.
